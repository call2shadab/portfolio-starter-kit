## Most favourite

- Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project

This is because I love troubleshooting customer issues and problems. I have been doing this task for 4 years now and I love to see the smile on customer's face after I answered their query.

- Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers

I have skill and passion to work on developing new features and implement customer feedback to see the enhancements they asked for being live.

- Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel

Being a dedicated support engineer for customer's I can act as their trusted adviser troubleshooting their critical issues on the go.

- Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent

I have been the part of quality reviews before and worked on analyzing misses to make sure the quality of the customer's response is top notch.

- Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites

Being part of wider group, I can see the smile on customer's faces when they see their queries being answered on the go on any 3P sites.

## Least favourite

- Help resolve billing issues for customers

I do not like to handle not technical queries and billing issues can be non technical in nature.

- Respond to 25+ support requests via email every day

Responding to 25+ support requests via email every day is exhausing.

- Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer

This is my least favourite task as it involves making customer believe that the issue is from the 3P and not our service mostly.

- Manage a support team

I can manage support team but this task is not on my priority at the moment as I would like to be an tech IC.

- Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use

I can work on analysis but this task is not on my favourite list as it mostly does not involve any technical challenges.
